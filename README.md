Block chain’s application in energy industry
 
As we learned from block chain’s class, especially featured with decentralization and anonymity, block chain has already generated profound influence on traditional industry. This report mainly focuses on its value to energy systems and some typical applications.

Instead of researching TMT industry, which is the most popular one with the highest valuation, the energy industry especially the electricity industry has a lot of space to grow.

As we can see from the diagram above, the growth rate of investment in energy industry in main South East Asia is obvious. Considering the current state of low labor cost and income, the prospect of South East Asia’s electricity industry is promising. As for specific country, the statistic data shows the same answer.

Above is the electricity demand forecast in every year’s investment, from demand’s aspect, the speed of growth can not be ignored. It is not difficult to judge that with the development of block chain technology and grid construction, the emerging block chain applications in electricity sector will keep prosperous.

Changes also happen to consumers in the era of block chain’s apply in energy sector. Consumers tend to become both consumers and producers who produce a share of their own energy while consuming it and in much more efficient ways. Considering the shift of consumers’ role, the energy system needs to be designed as a platform for improved service and for enabling new value streams.
