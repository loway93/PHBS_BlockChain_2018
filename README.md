Block chain’s application in energy industry
 
As we learned from block chain’s class, especially featured with decentralization and anonymity, block chain has already generated profound influence on traditional industry. This report mainly focuses on its value to energy systems and some typical applications.

Instead of researching TMT industry, which is the most popular one with the highest valuation, the energy industry especially the electricity industry has a lot of space to grow.

As we can see from the diagram above, the growth rate of investment in energy industry in main South East Asia is obvious. Considering the current state of low labor cost and income, the prospect of South East Asia’s electricity industry is promising. As for specific country, the statistic data shows the same answer.

Above is the electricity demand forecast in every year’s investment, from demand’s aspect, the speed of growth can not be ignored. It is not difficult to judge that with the development of block chain technology and grid construction, the emerging block chain applications in electricity sector will keep prosperous.

Changes also happen to consumers in the era of block chain’s apply in energy sector. Consumers tend to become both consumers and producers who produce a share of their own energy while consuming it and in much more efficient ways. Considering the shift of consumers’ role, the energy system needs to be designed as a platform for improved service and for enabling new value streams. 

From energy sector’s perspective, their stakeholders have a strong desire to reform current system. The changes include the need for deep decarbonization, integrating variable generation technologies, the growing national security implications of electricity reliance, evolving measures of reliability and the increasing customer choice. All the changes are commodity-based and difficult, highly regulated energy systems with complex, extensive supply chains, and old, expensive infrastructures. It is crucial that a range of breakthrough innovations in the electricity industry, including blockchain applications to be tested and applied in the whole energy value chain. New block chain applications for energy will help energy market participants to manage those changes. As a result, these applications will signal even greater changes to come, enabling new entrants and usages which are disruptive potential.

The first promising application is the energy system based on smart contract. The block chain technology makes it possible to build an energy system through smart contract. When the trade begins, smart contract will inform the system, which is based on rules already set. These rules can ensure all the energy and storage capacity will be automatically controlled, so the supply and demand will be balanced. For example, when electricity’s supply is greater than demand, the smart contract will be used to ensure surplus electricity supplying to storage devices automatically. On the contrary, when demand is greater than supply, the energy stored in storage devices will be used to where lacks electricity with the control of smart contract. In this way, smart contracts can directly control the flow of electrical energy in the grid and energy storage equipment. Smart contracts can also be used to manage virtual power plants. The transactional data is stored decentralized on the blockchain, making all energy flows and related business activities, distributed and secure accounting. All energy flows and transactions can be driven by smart contracts and can be recorded in a tamper-proof manner on the blockchain. This combination of smart contracts and distributed ledgers will have a direct impact on the grid (or natural gas pipeline network, etc.) and energy storage equipment.

The blockchain can help create a framework for improving DER visibility and control to meet the increasingly complex grid operating needs as variable renewable energy and other DERs are added to the power system. Distributed Energy (DER) is a physical and virtual asset characterized by small capacity and connection to low voltage and medium voltage networks. The DER is usually behind the meter or directly connected to the power distribution system. Examples of DER include rooftop and community solar, electric vehicles, energy storage and demand response. In recent years, DER devices have grown rapidly in the United States, mainly due to policies aimed at increasing the level of renewable energy. While DER has different attributes and contributions to the system, many of them can be used to increase grid flexibility, which can reduce operating costs and increase reliability. The blockchain can be easily accessed by the owner of the DER (or aggregator) to facilitate DER transactions. The blockchain utilized by DER entities, grid operators and utilities creates a trusted, secure system for managing the records, status and transactions of distributed resources. This helps provide operators with critical information that enhances the situational awareness required to manage unnecessary ramps, load forecasting, interconnection requirements, and other major tasks that ensure reliability. This also helps DER owners create new market potential for their resources.

In more technologically advanced use cases, a microgrid operating on a blockchain can implement a peer-to-peer (P2P) energy market. All members of the network have direct access to the energy exchange without the supervision of a centralized management agency. The blockchain extends the typical capacity of the P2P market through smart contracts. In this market, consumers can purchase energy directly from a desired source, such as solar or wind energy, by purchasing from a supplier of the resource. When the price of electricity reaches a certain level due to increased demand, electricity sales are automatically triggered between the owner of the solar photovoltaic array and a customer, and the microgrid only provides wires.

In general, the energy industry is a typical traditional industry with heavy assets and investment, and the blockchain is the most advanced technology. There is no doubt that the collision between the two will make a dazzling spark. The main problem nowadays is still to explore a development route and business model that conform to the actual situation of the industry. The core idea of the blockchain is decentralization, but it must balance security and efficiency. The energy industry is an essential infrastructure investment in any country. For all market participants, including Internet giants and startups, how to effectively design market-leading products for the specificity of the energy industry, how to deal with regulatory supervision and risk control pressure will be the main challenges facing enterprises. For consumers, while enjoying the convenience of emerging technology, how to better protect personal privacy and gain more benefits requires the participation of consumers, government and industry. The blockchain is coming, but how it comes about still needs further observation.
